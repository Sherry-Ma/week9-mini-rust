# Week9 mini rust project -- Fibonacci number
This mini project is a command line tool that calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive function called fib() and prints the result to the console.

To run the program, type: `cargo run`

This will compile and run the program. You can then enter a number when prompted, and the program will calculate the corresponding Fibonacci number and print it to the console.
 
```
Enter a number: 
10
The 10th Fibonacci number is: 55
```
